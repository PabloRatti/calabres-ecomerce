E-commerce project for a Wheels and Tires company:
The project is now in production, so this version has test keys to access the payment API, the payment API is “Decidir” this company is from Argentina and allow the owner of the page to get payments from the page as if this where happening in his Posnet (company payment getaway) and allow the customers to have access to particular payment plans from the company.

Credit cards to test payments: 
	Visa: 4507990000004905
	MasterCard prisma: 5299910010000015
	Amex: 37395319235100

Al the routes in fetch methods are the original URLs so to test in local must change them for localhost.

Development: 
	- React.js: Bootstrap 4, React Strap, Styled Components, React Context, React Router, React scroll, React Loader.
	
	- Node.js: API developed with Node, Express and MySQL. 
		(I know! MongoDB is better to work with React and Node, but the client wanted SQL).
